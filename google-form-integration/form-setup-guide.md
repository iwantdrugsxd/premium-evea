1. Go to [Google Apps Script](https://script.google.com)
2. Click "New Project"
3. Replace the default code with the content from `apps-script.js`
4. Save the project

### Step 2: Set Up Form Trigger
1. In Apps Script, click on "Triggers" (clock icon)
2. Click "Add Trigger"
3. Configure:
   - Function: `onFormSubmit`
   - Event source: "From form"
   - Event type: "On form submit"
   - Select your Google Form
4. Click "Save"

### Step 3: Deploy as Web App
1. Click "Deploy" > "New deployment"
2. Choose "Web app" as type
3. Set:
   - Execute as: "Me"
   - Who has access: "Anyone"
4. Click "Deploy"
5. Copy the web app URL (you'll need this for the form)

### Step 4: Update API URL
In the Apps Script code, update this line with your actual domain:
```javascript
const apiUrl = 'https://premium-evea.vercel.app/api/vendors/google-form';
```

## ðŸ§ª Testing

### Test the Integration
1. In Apps Script, run the `testFormSubmission` function
2. Check your database to see if the test vendor was created
3. Submit a real form to verify the complete flow

### Test Form Submission
1. Fill out the Google Form with test data
2. Submit the form
3. Check your Supabase database for the new vendor entry
4. Verify the confirmation email was sent

## ðŸ“§ Email Notifications

The script automatically sends confirmation emails to vendors when they register. Make sure:
1. The Apps Script project has Gmail API access
2. The email template in the script matches your brand
3. Test the email functionality

## ðŸ”’ Security Considerations

1. **API Key Protection**: Don't expose your Supabase service key in client-side code
2. **Form Validation**: The API endpoint validates all required fields
3. **Rate Limiting**: Consider adding rate limiting to prevent spam
4. **Data Sanitization**: All form data is sanitized before database insertion
